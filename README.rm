dashboard
=========

$dashboard The Dashboard is a collection of different smaller apps that I make for myself for collecting content.
The contents are supposed to be notes, people, locations, konversations, dates and index cards.
The benefit for this is that you can keep order in your head by putting your ideas in a littel box where you can later order them.
It is supposed to become some kind of brwoser game in the end. Or more like a tool for making point-and-click adventures.
